# Configuration

At initial startup (when the file doesn't exist yet), the ``config.yaml`` file is created 
and filled with default values which there aren't a lot of.

Refer to the dist file located at internal/assets/config/config.dist.yaml

Make sure the configuration file is only readable by the user running your 
*CertMaker* instance.
